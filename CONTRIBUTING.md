# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We don't have so
many rules, except some basic ones to make sure the code is well written and the
code is well tested.

- Please, properly document functions and global identifiers.
- Make sure to write tests where applicable, and that all tests pass.
- Make changes to the codebase in meaninful chunks in order to have meaninful
  commit messages.
- Avoid huge PRs, especially those that address more than one issue, and most
  especially those that alter a lot of existing code. This will aid proper
  review. If you're tackling more than one assignment, break up your PR.

To report bugs and issues, or make feature requests, kindly
[open an issue](https://github.com/chee-zaram/cryfe/issues). Please, look
through to see that there's no similar open issue already.

If you spot something you think you can fix, clone this repo, create a named
branch, and open a PR to merge your named branch to `chee-zaram/cryfe`.
